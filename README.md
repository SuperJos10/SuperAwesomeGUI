Ye cuz my lazy ass couldn't be FUCKED to make this before heres how you use this shitty script I made in like 10 minutes.

The textbox literally just works as a value box for all the buttons (Decal ID, Player modifications, etc.)
The lolololol button just plays Brace Yourself by Zenorachi and messes with the skybox.
Thats about it! Mostly self-explanitory so yeah bye.
